Repository with reproducible analyses from 2023 related to:

Visser, R.M., 2015. Imperial timber? Dendrochronological evidence for large-scale road building along the Roman limes in the Netherlands. Journal of Archaeological Science 53, 243â€“254. doi:10.1016/j.jas.2014.10.017

The analyses were originally performed in Matlab, but could not be recreated and were therefore redone using R in 2023. The results of this analyses will be discussed in the discussion of my PhD-thesis.
