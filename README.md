Repository with reproducible analyses from 2023 related to:

Visser, R.M., 2015. Imperial timber? Dendrochronological evidence for large-scale road building along the Roman limes in the Netherlands. Journal of Archaeological Science 53, 243â€“254. doi:10.1016/j.jas.2014.10.017

The analyses were originally performed in Matlab, but could not be recreated and were therefore redone using R. The paper has been updated for inclusion as chapter of my PhD-thesis.
